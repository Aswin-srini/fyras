global_models.py – Global Schema (shared across tenants)
This module defines the global schema for the AI Firewall system.
It includes shared collections such as user logins, tenant metadata, tier plans, global rules, and LLM provider configurations
These models form the foundational layer for multi-tenant management, firewall versioning, and rule inheritance.

tenant_models.py – Tenant-Specific Schema (isolated per tenant).
This module defines tenant-level schema objects used for isolated LLM configurations,
API key storage, custom rule overrides, user-role mapping, token quotas, and audit logs.
Each tenant gets a separate MongoDB database using these models to ensure data isolation, customizability, and compliance.
